When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-> when I need to work in different places or with someone else. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-> Maybe I don’t need to show pieces of code at that time, or I didn’t mean to show those commits. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-> I would use fork when I don’t have permission to work on a remote repository. I would use clones to get the data from my remote repository to my computer. I would use branches when I want to test something new that I don’t want to impact on the master branch right now. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

-> this way we know if we are up-to-date with the remote repository.
