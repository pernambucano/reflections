When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-> when I need to work in different places or with someone else. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-> Maybe I don’t need to show pieces of code at that time, or I didn’t mean to show those commits.
