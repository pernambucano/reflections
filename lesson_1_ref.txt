 How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

-> It was helpful because I could see in which line the bug was introduced. This way I could easily fix it. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

-> I could compare two different versions and see if I made a mistake or I could use the old versions as a backup if something goes wrong. 


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

-> pros :
        we can choose when we want to save, and it reduces the quantity of diffs to examine later.
    cons: 
        we have to think about doing it, losting time doing this. 
        
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-> I think it's because version control systems like Git work a lot with code, and code is usually split into diferent files, while others like Google Docs work with one file at a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

-> I use git log to see the list of commits and the git diff comand to see the differences between two documents

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

-> We are confident that if we make a mistake we can find it accurately and 'go back in time' if needed. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

-> I'll be working on a project.
